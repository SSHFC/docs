### Mortgage Repossession

The system allows for mortgages to be repossessed. However, three consecutive missed payments by 15th of every month will result in mortgage being marked for foreclosure. The first missed payment warrants demand notes in the form of e-mails, SMS, generated letter. Second notifications are usually sent upon missed payment default not redeemed based on negative arrears for second consecutive month being the 15th. Third notifications also in the form of e-mails,SMS, generated letters are sent out ot inform clients of repossession based on negative arrears for the third  consecutive month, 15th of every month.
There is an automated freeze of account and discontinuation of interest calculation.  These marked mortgages can either be re-activated with the appropriate approval or be foreclosed. Either unfreeze or repossess by General ledger update/reversal for interest repayment and principal.
